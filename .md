# Store User data as region specific

To do this task there are multiple approach-

1. Can use the Google map api to get the location address of the user and then do mapping in our DB according to that, And then as per the city,state, and country we decide the region to store data.

2. Another approach we can directly ask for user to choose the city and then we check that city belongs to which origin, and store data as per region.

3. **Third approach** is we can use shapeFiles of india, and make polygon from that file as per region. And whenever customer register with lat, lng we check that lat, lng is in which polygon. After polygon serch we can have the region, and then we can store region wise also.

- at the second step you have to install dependencies. for developement dev-dependencies also.

- do npm start, I put logs for server started

- Open request.http, You have to use rest-client vs code extention in other IDE, run from there and test in postman also.
